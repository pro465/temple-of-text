# The Temple of texts

The Temple of Texts is a variation of [The Library of Babel website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel_(website)).

It modifies it so that it:
    1. It contains every possible finite string of text of a certain character set (see below for details), instead of just 410*3200 charactes.
    2. The feeling of being lost is enhanced by simulating only moving and reading, instead of being dinimished by add extraneous features that break that feeling (like searching).

the character set is `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789,.!? `.
